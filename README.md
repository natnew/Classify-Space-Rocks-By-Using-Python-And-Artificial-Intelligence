#### Project:
- In this project...
- I conducted some research about artificial intelligence (AI) and how the technology can be used to enhance a project. This was so that I could create my own program that uses AI.
- I used **Visual Studio Code, Python, and Jupyter Notebook**. 
- Once I imported the libraries into the Jupyter Notebook, I cleaned and separated the data. I resized the images because computers expect images to be the same size. If images vary in size, they're not as easy for the computer to process.
- 20% of the cleaned images were for training and the other 80% was for testing. I then loaded random images from the two datasets.
- I loaded the images into the computer. And gave them labels to indicate what type of rock is in each photo.
- I built a neural network (or deep learning network) to learn the associations between features and each rock type.
- Next, I trained the program. I use the training data from NASA. I added code to help the program become accurate in classifying space rocks.
- I used the model to make predictions.
- Finally, I tested my complete AI model!
