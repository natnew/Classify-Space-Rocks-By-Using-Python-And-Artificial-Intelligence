#### Project:
In this project...

I learned about artificial intelligence (AI) and how the technology can be used to enhance a project. This was so that I could create my own program that uses AI.

I used **Visual Studio Code, Python, and Jupyter Notebook**. I reviewed code to clean rock images to prepare data for the program. Then I looked at the code to **create and train the AI model**.

#### Skills gained from this project:
* Import AI libraries
* Download and import NASA data to use with an AI program
* Learn the importance of cleaning and separating data
* Discover how computers read photos as images in binary format
* Use code to clean and separate data, read and display images, and assign classifications
